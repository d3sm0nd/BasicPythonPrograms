# 🎮 Number Guessing Game  

Welcome to the **Number Guessing Game**, a simple yet fun game where you try to guess the number chosen by the computer within a specified range and limited attempts. Test your guessing skills and see if you can beat the game!  

---

## 📝 **Features**  
- **Custom Range:** Set the range for the random number.  
- **Randomized Number Selection:** The computer randomly selects a number within the specified range.  
- **Limited Attempts:** You are given a limited number of tries to guess the correct number.  
- **Interactive Feedback:** Get hints if your guess is too high or too low.  

---

## 🚀 **How to Play**  
1. Run the program.  
2. Enter a range of numbers (e.g., 1 to 100).  
3. The computer will randomly pick a number within that range.  
4. Guess the number, and the program will guide you with hints like:  
   - "Your guess is too high."  
   - "Your guess is too low."  
5. Try to guess the correct number within the allowed attempts.  
6. Win the game by guessing correctly, or lose if you run out of tries.  

---

## 🧩 **Code Explanation**  
- The program starts by asking the player to define a range (`range1` and `range2`).  
- A random number is selected using `random.choice()` from the specified range.  
- The number of allowed attempts is determined based on the range size.  
- A loop continues until:  
  - The player guesses the correct number, or  
  - The player runs out of attempts.  
- The program provides feedback after each guess, helping the player adjust their next attempt.
